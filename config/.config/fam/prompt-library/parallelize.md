Please analyze these recommendations and create a structured implementation plan that identifies:

1. **Parallel workstreams** - Which recommendations can be tackled simultaneously by different agents/team members?

2. **Dependencies** - Which recommendations must be completed before others can begin? Map out the dependency chain.

3. **Sequencing strategy** - What's the optimal order to tackle each recommendation, considering dependencies and priorities?

4. **Resource allocation** - How should we distribute the work across available agents to maximize efficiency?

The output should be a clear execution roadmap showing what can start immediately, what needs to wait, and how the workstreams interconnect.
